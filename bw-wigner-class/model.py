QUESTIONS:
    How do I say that X-axis does not matter but Y-axis does
    Is it possible to do an event style model? This type of data (EC trains)
    is unique in that we are confident each event is 1 species, and they
    are all related. We really only care about classification at the event
    level, not at the detection level.
